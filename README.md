# NearestNeighbors
Nearest Neighbors in go. Heavily inspired by the Julia packge [NearestNeighbors.jl](https://github.com/KristofferC/NearestNeighbors.jl).

Do not use this package in production. I would suggest using the [kdtree module](https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum@v0.14.0/spatial/kdtree) that is part of [gonum](https://pkg.go.dev/gonum.org/v1/gonum@v0.14.0).
